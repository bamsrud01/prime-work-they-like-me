# They Like Me!

This program accesses information on the server about people's bios and adds it to the DOM.  It also allows users to add likes to each person.

## Features

- The bios and likes of people are stored in server router files.

- These files are accessed using AJAX requests.

- Bio information is appended to the DOM.

- The button to like each person will access a counter variable in the server.  It updates the like, and adds it to the DOM.
